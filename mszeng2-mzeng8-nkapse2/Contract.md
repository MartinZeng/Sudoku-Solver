# Communication
## Team Meetings
Team members will take turns noting the deliverables and writing the week's development log on a weekly rotation system. A weekly one-hour meeting will be held on Saturday evenings, during which the following week's deliverables will be determined. The meeting will be hosted on Zoom. This will also serve as a reflection on the previous week's work. During this meeting, the team member that is on rotation must document important decisions made during the meeting in a shared Google Document in preparation for the following week's development log. 
## Assistance
Team members commit to being responsive on text message and Discord and will respond to inquiries through the aforementioned channels within 48 hours. 
## Respect
Team members agree to allow each other to speak freely in discussions and no decisions - including those regarding deliverables - will be made without majority vote.
# Collaboration
## Work Distribution
On a weekly basis, team members will deliberate and delegate deliverables based on interest and ability. A mid-week check in will be used to re-assess the distribution in the event that a certain deliverable is more or less work than anticipated. Every team member will handle roughly one-third of the work required for the project.
## Time Commitment

Each team member will be expected to spend 4 to 6 hours a week contributing to the project. If on a given week, a team member is unable to spend their required time on the project, they absolutely must make up for it the following week. 

## Conflict Resolution

Should a team member consistently miss weekly meetings or fail to abide by the weekly time commitment guidelines, they will be warned once by other team mates. If behavior that obstructs the progress of the project continues after this warning, course staff will be notified.
